# Intelligent-Phishing-Message-NITA

A machine learning project that classifies emails and SMS as phishing or legitimate.  
This project was developed as part of our Capstone Project.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of text (cleaning, stopwords removal, stemming).
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**.
- Classification using Machine Learning models.
- Deployment with **Streamlit** for easy user interaction.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Collected and labeled ~1,250 messages (Ham = 0, Phishing = 1).
- Includes both emails and SMS.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning.  
2. Feature extraction using **TF-IDF**.  
3. Model training and evaluation.  
4. Streamlit app for real-time message classification.

## 🔮 Future Work

- Expanding dataset with multilingual phishing samples.
- Improving detection with deep learning models.
- Adding API support for integration with email servers.
